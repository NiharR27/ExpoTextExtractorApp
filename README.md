Here’s a polished README tailored for **`react-native-ml-kit`** (by a7medev) focusing on Text Recognition—designed for a fresh project or documentation. It includes setup, usage, permissions, and troubleshooting tips based on the repository and npm info. Let me know if you’d like CI badges, GitHub project link insertion, or example images/commands.
